## “Rock, Paper Scissors” game 
# Code explanation:
We start by importing the random module to help us generate random choices for the computer.
We define a list options containing the choices "rock", "paper", and "scissors".
The user is prompted to enter their choice (rock, paper, or scissors) using the input function. We convert the input to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison.
The computer's choice is randomly selected from the options list using random.choice(options).
We print both the user's and computer's choices to the console.
We then check for the different scenarios:
If the user's choice matches the computer's choice, we print "It's a tie!".
If the user wins based on the game rules (rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, paper beats rock), we print "You win!".
Otherwise, we print "Computer wins!" indicating the computer's victory.
